This is a sample project of DataJuggler.PixelDatabase.

I demonstrate how to load a source image, select an output folder, and then load a list.

The Documents folder contains a sample image a list of 100 Sound Effects titles, generated by Azure 
Open AI Gpt40.

Run the program, select the source image, selectfrom the list.
